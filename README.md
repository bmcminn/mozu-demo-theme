# Brandtley's Mozu Demo Theme

> Version: 1.0.5

_**NOTE:** I would highly suggest looking at the [GETTING_STARTED.md](/GETTING_STARTED.md) file if you have not already configured your local dev environment for Mozu theme development._


## TODO:

- [ ] Document features of this repo
- [ ] Better docs on build.js
    - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6VNhqKDM4E
- [ ] break out the `.components/theme-ui/` folder into `.theme-ui/`
- [ ] turn `.components/` into `.theme-json/` OR `.theme/`
